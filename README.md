# Frontend Mentor - Planet Fact Site
This is my solution to the [Planet Fact Site](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f) challenge. 

## Design Brief
Build an 8-page planets fact site. Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs

## Tech
For this project i chose to use the following tech:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - I like how NextJS handles routing and pages.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I've grown to love Tailwind and prefer to use it on all of projects. 
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - I'm slowly working on improving my understanding of how TypeScript works... slowly. 

## What i learned
1. This project was really useful in teaching me how to plan out a project. There were a lot of learning moments when building this app that will absolutely help me develop websites better in the future. 

2. With Tailwind specifically, i learned how important using a Mobile First design strategy can be. 

3. One of my biggest takeaways though was learning how use [data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) features in NextJS. 

## Final Thoughts
This project was a lot of fun to create and i learned so much. There are a few layout quirks and refactoring that i know could be improved on, but after spending a bit of time on this project, i feel that im ready to move onto something freshhh.
